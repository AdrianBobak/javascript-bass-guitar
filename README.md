The idea is to hold a keyboard upside down with hands, as a guitar. The frets are located on F-keys and the strings on Num-keys.

The keys and corresponding strings: 0: E, 1 or 2: A, 4 or 5: G, 7 or 8: D

There are 12 frets, from F1 to F12. When you click E-string, you play E-note (empty string). When you hold F1 and click E-string key, you play F-note.
